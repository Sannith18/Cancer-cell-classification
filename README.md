This application is classifying cancer cells based on their features and determining whether they are 'malignant' or 'benign'. In this article, we will use Scikit-learn to build a classifier for cancer cell detection.

Overview of the Dataset:

The Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset consists of:
1. 569 instances (tumor samples)
2. 30 attributes (features), including radius, texture, perimeter, and area of tumors
3. Two classification labels:
   - 0 (Malignant): Cancerous
   - 1 (Benign): Non-cancerous
